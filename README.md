## üìù Project Overview: Setting the stage for our data exploration journey
---

This project reflects my personal journey into SQL and its ability to transform raw datasets into actionable insights. The **Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project** is a fictional case study crafted to simulate real-world scenarios of database auditing, governance, and community-centered decision-making.  

At the heart of the story is an independent audit of the Maji Ndogo water project, where discrepancies in water source records demanded closer scrutiny. By writing SQL queries, building Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and experimenting with joins and aggregations, I explored how data can reveal both truths and irregularities ‚Äî ultimately shaping better governance.  

For me, this project wasn‚Äôt just about practicing SQL. It was about **learning how to weave analysis into a narrative** ‚Äî turning queries and numbers into a compelling data story that resonates with both technical and non-technical audiences.

### üìß Audit Correspondence (Narrative Layer of the Project)  

#### From: **Independent Auditor (fictional role I adopted in the project)**  

**Subject:** Audit review of Maji Ndogo water project database  

Dear President Naledi,  

As part of the ongoing review of the Maji Ndogo water project, my team and I conducted an independent audit of the water source database. The purpose was to verify the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the stored data, especially after earlier reports pointed out possible discrepancies.  

Through systematic SQL queries and data checks, we examined the records for signs of inconsistency and tampering. I am pleased to share that most of the data aligns well with principles of transparency and accountability. 
However, a few anomalies were detected ‚Äî data entries that appear to have been altered. I have attached the flagged records for your immediate review. Addressing these irregularities will further strengthen the credibility of the project and ensure that data-driven governance remains at the forefront of decision-making.  

Respectfully,  
**Independent Auditor**

## üîó Generating an ERD: Understanding the database structure
---

<details>

![ERD for Maji Ndogo water_services database](https://github.com/lawaloa/SQL_Project_3/blob/main/EER_Project_3.png?raw=true)

</details>

Before I could integrate the auditor‚Äôs report, I realized it was crucial to fully understand the **database structure**. This meant starting with an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to map out how the tables in the `md_water_services` database connected to each other.  

The **visits** table quickly stood out as the central table. It links to other tables using foreign keys:  
- `location_id` ‚Üí connected to the **location** table  
- `source_id` ‚Üí connected to the **water_source** table  
- `assigned_employee_id` ‚Üí connected to the **employee** table  

Each of these is a primary key in its respective table, but they act as foreign keys within **visits**.  

Here‚Äôs how I interpreted some of the relationships:  

- **Location ‚Üî Visits (One-to-Many):**  
  Each unique entry in the `location` table represents one place we‚Äôve been, while the `visits` table logs *every single time* we visited that location. Naturally, one location can have many visits, making this a one-to-many relationship.  

- **Visits ‚Üî Water Quality (Intended One-to-One):**  
  My initial understanding was that every recorded visit should have *exactly one* corresponding water quality score. That would make this a one-to-one relationship. However, when I checked the ERD, it showed a many-to-one relationship ‚Äî which didn‚Äôt make sense.  

I double-checked the database and confirmed that `record_id` is unique in both the `visits` and `water_quality` tables, which supports the one-to-one relationship I expected. To correct this, I updated the relationship in the ERD by editing the foreign key settings and changing the cardinality to **one-to-one**.  

This small exercise was a powerful reminder: **getting the relationships right at the start prevents big headaches later**. Misrepresenting relationships could lead to faulty joins, misleading results, and ultimately bad decisions. By carefully validating the ERD, I ensured my queries (and the audit integration) would stand on solid ground.  



## üì• Integrating the Report: Adding the auditor report to our database
---

After mapping out the database structure with the ERD, the next step was to bring in the **auditor‚Äôs report**. This report came as a `.csv` file containing independent verification of water source quality across multiple locations.  

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Creating the Auditor Report Table  

To prepare the database, I created a table to hold the auditor‚Äôs results:  

<details>
<summary>Click to view SQL query</summary>
  
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `auditor_report`;
CREATE TABLE `auditor_report` (
  `location_id` VARCHAR(32),
  `type_of_water_source` VARCHAR(64),
  `true_water_source_score` INT DEFAULT NULL,
  `statements` VARCHAR(255)
);
```

</details>

I then imported the `.csv` file. The dataset contained **1,620 records**, each representing a revisited water source.  

---

### üìë Auditor‚Äôs Dataset Structure  

The dataset included the following columns:  

- **`location_id`** ‚Üí unique identifier for each site  
- **`type_of_water_source`** ‚Üí e.g., well, pump, stream  
- **`true_water_source_score`** ‚Üí independently verified quality score  
- **`statements`** ‚Üí remarks from locals at the site  

---

### üîç Framing the Key Questions  

At this point, I wanted to answer two main questions:  

1. **Is there a difference between the surveyors‚Äô recorded scores and the auditors‚Äô scores?**  
2. **If so, are there patterns in those differences?**  

---

### üîó Linking Auditor Data with Surveyor Data  

A challenge appeared:  

- The **`auditor_report`** table used `location_id`  
- The **`water_quality`** table used `record_id`  
- The **`visits`** table acted as the bridge, since it links `location_id` and `record_id`

To bring these together, I wrote the following query and to make the results easier to read, I also renamed the scores:  

- `surveyor_score` ‚Üí from the `water_quality` table  
- `auditor_water_score` ‚Üí from the `auditor_report` table    

<details>
<summary>Click to view SQL query</summary>
  
```sql
SELECT 
    v.location_id AS visit_location_id,
    v.record_id AS visit_record_id,
    a.location_id AS auditor_location_id,
    a.true_water_source_score AS auditor_water_score,
    w.subjective_quality_score AS surveyor_score
FROM visits AS v
JOIN auditor_report AS a
    ON v.location_id = a.location_id
JOIN water_quality AS w
    ON v.record_id = w.record_id;
```
  
</details>


üìä **Sample Output**

The query produced a comparison of the auditor‚Äôs independent scores and the surveyor‚Äôs recorded scores for the same sites:

| AkRu08112         | 59367           | AkRu08112      | 3                        | 4                        |
| AkLu02044         | 37379           | AkLu02044      | 0                        | 1                        |
| ...               | ...             | ...            | ...                      | ...                      |

</details>

#### üßπ Cleaning Up the Join Results

At first, my query gave me **two `location_id` columns** ‚Äî one from `visits` and one from `auditor_report`. Since they were duplicates, I decided to keep **just one `location_id`** (from `visits`) along with `record_id` as the anchor for linking data.  



<details>
<summary>Click to view üíª Cleaned SQL Query</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
    v.record_id AS record_id,
    v.location_id AS location_id,
    w.subjective_quality_score AS surveyor_score,
    a.true_water_source_score AS auditor_water_score
FROM visits AS v
JOIN auditor_report AS a
    ON v.location_id = a.location_id
JOIN water_quality AS w
    ON v.record_id = w.record_id;
```

</details>

üìä **Cleaned Sample Output**

Now the output is tidy and easy to interpret ‚Äî just one `location_id`, plus the surveyor‚Äôs and auditor‚Äôs scores:

<details>

| 5185       | SoRu34980    | 2               | 1              |
| 59367      | AkRu08112    | 4               | 3              |

| ...        | ...          | ...             | ...            |

</details>


### üîé Analyzing Auditor vs Surveyor Scores

Since we were joining **1,620 rows of data**, I wanted to make sure I kept track of how many rows I got back each time I ran a query.  

- In MySQL Workbench, you can increase the limit (from *1000 rows* to something like *10000*).  
- Or you can force SQL to give you everything using `LIMIT 10000`.  

With that set, I moved on to the analysis.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Check Where Scores Agree

The first thing I wanted to know was: **Do the auditors‚Äô independent scores agree with the surveyors‚Äô recorded scores?**  

I tried two approaches:  
- Use a `WHERE` clause to check if `surveyor_score = auditor_score`  
- Or subtract the two scores and check if the result = `0`

<details>
<summary>üíª SQL Query (Checking Agreement)</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
    v.record_id AS visit_recordid,
    a.location_id AS auditor_locationid,
    a.true_water_source_score AS auditor_score,
    w.subjective_quality_score AS surveyor_score
FROM visits AS v
JOIN auditor_report AS a
    ON v.location_id = a.location_id
JOIN water_quality AS w
    ON v.record_id = w.record_id
WHERE (a.true_water_source_score - w.subjective_quality_score = 0);
```

</details>

üî¢ **Result**: I got **2,505 rows**. But wait‚Ä¶ some locations were visited multiple times, which introduced duplicates.


#### üßπ Step 2: Remove Duplicates

To fix this, I restricted results to only the **first visit per site** using `v.visit_count = 1`.

<details> 
<summary>üíª SQL Query (Removing Duplicates)</summary>

```sql  
SELECT 
    v.record_id AS visit_recordid,
    a.location_id AS auditor_locationid,
    a.true_water_source_score AS auditor_score,
    w.subjective_quality_score AS surveyor_score
FROM visits AS v
JOIN auditor_report AS a
    ON v.location_id = a.location_id
JOIN water_quality AS w
    ON v.record_id = w.record_id
WHERE (a.true_water_source_score - w.subjective_quality_score = 0)
AND  v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details>

üî¢ **Result**: Now I got **1,518 rows**.

üìä **Interpretation**:

- Auditor visited **1,620 sites**
- **1,518 matched** the surveyor‚Äôs scores
- That‚Äôs **94% agreement** ‚úÖ
- Which means **102 sites (6%) had discrepancies** ‚ùå

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 3: Look at the Mismatches

To inspect the mismatched cases, I just flipped the operator (`!= 0` instead of `= 0`).

<details> 
<summary>üíª SQL Query (Finding Discrepancies)</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
    v.record_id AS visit_record_id,
    a.location_id AS auditor_location_id,
    a.true_water_source_score AS auditor_score,
    w.subjective_quality_score AS surveyor_score
FROM visits AS v
JOIN auditor_report AS a
    ON v.location_id = a.location_id
JOIN water_quality AS w
    ON v.record_id = w.record_id
WHERE (a.true_water_source_score - w.subjective_quality_score != 0)
AND  v.visit_count = 1;
```

| ...          | ...        | ...            | ...             |

</details>

#### üîç Step 4: Double-Check Water Source Integrity

Since we relied heavily on the `type_of_water_source` in earlier analysis, I wanted to make sure these mismatched scores didn‚Äôt mean we also had mismatched water sources.

So I joined the `water_source` table and compared the auditor‚Äôs source type with the surveyor‚Äôs source type.

<details> 
<summary>üíª SQL Query (Checking Source Type Integrity)</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
    v.record_id AS visit_record_id,
    a.location_id AS auditor_location_id,
    a.true_water_source_score AS auditor_score,
    w.subjective_quality_score AS surveyor_score,
    a.type_of_water_source AS auditor_source,
    s.type_of_water_source AS survey_source
FROM visits AS v
JOIN auditor_report AS a
    ON v.location_id = a.location_id
JOIN water_quality AS w
    ON v.record_id = w.record_id
JOIN water_source AS s
    ON v.source_id = s.source_id
WHERE (a.true_water_source_score - w.subjective_quality_score != 0)
AND  v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details>

> [!Note]
> ### üéØ Conclusion
> 
> Even though **scores differed in 102 cases**, the **water source types matched**.
> This means the **core integrity of the source data remains intact**, and our earlier analyses using `type_of_water_source` are still valid.
>
> Once I confirmed this, I removed the extra `JOIN` and columns again to keep things simple.

## üîó Linking Records: Joining employee data to the report
---

Now that I‚Äôve identified the 102 incorrect records, the next step was to dig deeper and see who was responsible for assigning those scores.

At some of the locations, employees recorded incorrect scores ‚Äî and those records made it into this error set.

I think there are two possible reasons this happened:

These workers are humans, and mistakes are bound to occur.

Alternatively, there could have been intentional misreporting (which would be more serious).

Either way, the **employees were the source of the discrepancies**, so I decided to **JOIN the** `assigned_employee_id` from the `employee` table with the query. This allowed me to directly link each incorrect record to the staff member who submitted it.

Here‚Äôs the query I wrote:

<details> 
<summary>üíª Click to view SQL query</summary>
  
```sql
SELECT 
    v.record_id AS visit_record_id, 
    a.location_id AS auditor_location_id, 
    a.true_water_source_score AS auditor_score,
    w.subjective_quality_score AS surveyor_score,
    e.assigned_employee_id AS assigned_employee_id
FROM visits AS v
JOIN auditor_report AS a
    ON v.location_id = a.location_id
JOIN water_quality AS w
    ON v.record_id = w.record_id
JOIN employee AS e
    ON v.assigned_employee_id = e.assigned_employee_id
WHERE (a.true_water_source_score - w.subjective_quality_score != 0)
  AND v.visit_count = 1;
```

</details>

‚úÖ **What I got back (sample)**:

<details>

</details>

By surfacing the `assigned_employee_id`, I could now clearly **trace the errors back to specific employees**. This was the key to uncovering potential patterns ‚Äî for instance, *are the same employees making repeated mistakes?*

### üßë‚Äçüíº Linking Incorrect Records to Employees

Now that I‚Äôve tied the errors back to employees, I realized that employee IDs alone weren‚Äôt very helpful for identifying patterns. Thankfully, the `employee` table also stores names, so I updated the query to pull in **employee names** instead of IDs.

This way, I can directly see *which employees* are responsible for the discrepancies ‚Äî making the results more interpretable.
