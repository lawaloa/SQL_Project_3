## 📝 Introduction  

This project was inspired by my journey into SQL and its ability to transform raw datasets into meaningful insights for communities. The **Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project** is a fictional case study designed to mimic real-world scenarios of data auditing, governance, and community-driven decision-making.  

The story centers around an independent audit of the Maji Ndogo water project, where discrepancies in water source records called for a closer look at the integrity of the database. Using SQL queries, Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and complex joins, I explored how data could uncover both truths and inconsistencies — ultimately empowering leaders to make informed choices.  

The personal goal of this project was not only to sharpen my SQL skills but also to tell a compelling data story. By blending technical execution with narrative, I learned how to **communicate data findings in a way that resonates with both technical and non-technical audiences.**

### 📧 Audit Correspondence (Project Narrative)  

#### From: **Tendai Mubarak** (Chief Auditor)  
Subject: Results of audit on Maji Ndogo water project  

Dear President Naledi,  

I hope this email finds you in the best of health and spirits. As you know, my team and I were tasked with conducting an independent audit of the Maji Ndogo water project, specifically the database recording water sources in our country, following the inconsistencies identified by Chidi Kunto and his team.  

For clarity, in this specific audit, our objective was to assess the integrity, and accuracy of the data stored in the database. Auditing a database involves verifying that the data it contains is both accurate and has not been tampered with, thereby ensuring that the information can be relied upon for decision-making and governance.  

I am pleased to report that the audit is now complete. After a rigorous examination of the database's records, as well as the procedures in place for data entry and modification, we can confirm that the vast majority of the data aligns with the principles of good governance and data-driven decision-making that you have so vigorously championed.  

However, we did find some data that was tampered with, which requires your immediate attention. I have attached the records I have re-examined for your review.  

Thank you for entrusting us with this crucial task. Your commitment to accountability and transparency is truly commendable.  

Sincerely,  
**Tendai Mubarak**  
Chief Auditor

#### From: **Aziza Naledi** (President)  
Re: Results of audit on Maji Ndogo water project  

Dear Tendai,  

Thank you for the meticulous work you and your team have put into auditing the Maji Ndogo water project. The depth of your analysis reflects your commitment to excellence and accountability.  

I am heartened to learn that our operations are largely in line with our principles of governance. At the same time, your findings are valuable as they highlight areas we can further improve.  

Rest assured, I will be convening our data team to address any issues and take any steps necessary to ensure the integrity of our data.  

Once again, I commend you and your team for your hard work and dedication. Maji Ndogo is indeed counting on all of us to deliver on our promises. Thank you for playing your part.  

All the best,  
**Aziza Naledi**

## ✨ Personal Takeaway  

Working on this project has reinforced my belief that **data is more than numbers — it is a powerful story-telling tool.** SQL empowered me to not only detect inconsistencies but also to narrate the findings in a way that matters for decision-making and governance.
